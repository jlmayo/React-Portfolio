### **The Scenario**
The task for this assignment was to create an updated version of the student portfolio using React and deploying to GitHub Pages.

### **Requirements Met**
* The portfolio contains the developer's name, a recent photo, links to sections about them, their work, and their contact information.
* Clickable links in the navigation bar scroll through the UI to the appropriate sections
* Clicking on the Work link scrolls to a section that features titled images of the developer's applications
* In the Work section, the first clickable image is larger than the others and navigation points to the developer's first application
* In the Work section, the smaller, clickable images point to other deployed applications

### **Requirements Outstanding**
* At first attempt, responsive layout is not functional
* No comments have yet been made in the HTML or CSS

### **Result**
Most of the requirements were met. If grading occurs before I can add responsive layout, then I will submit an additional attempt once I have a chance to solicit help from tutors, instructors, or classmates.

The web page is very basic for now, but there is time and room to grow as I learn new skills.

### **Contributors**
In order to learn how to do this from start to finish, I coded along with [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/0h2b4ftbZcU). I made adjustments for style and to meet acceptance criteria.
