### **The Scenario**
The task for this assignment was to create an updated version of the student portfolio using React and deploying to GitHub Pages.

### **Requirements Met**
* The portfolio contains the developer's name, a recent photo, links to sections about them, their work, and their contact information.
* Clickable links in the navigation bar scroll through the UI to the appropriate sections
* Portfolio contains a Header, Navigation Bar, Footer, and sections for content pertaining to the developer's biography, a showcase of her best work, and a contact form.

### **Requirements Outstanding**
* At first attempt, responsive layout is functional but incomplete.
* The difference between NavLink and HashLink meant that I had to choose between the acceptance criteria of scrolling through the single page app or having the link remain highlighted on the current page. I chose scroll because I couldn't figure out how to do both.

 ### Usage

This portfolio is intended to showcase the developer's work and to thereby present it to future employers.

### **Contributors**
In order to learn how to do this from start to finish, I coded along with [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/0h2b4ftbZcU). I made adjustments for style and to meet acceptance criteria.
